Okay, it's time to actually come up with design decisions.

Parameters...
$from $text $now $time $me
Say, action, privatereply
Various user-defined data... either key-value or key-manyvalues
$name would be a key-manyvalue.  $person would be too.
Can values be tuples?

How do I want these things to work?

Memo for foo, bar and bop: text
Memo foo, bar, bop: text
What are my memos?
Memo me: stuff

Check my memos without deleting them.
